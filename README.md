Requirements
Install the required Python libraries.
Download the dataset from Kaggle: Image Classification Dataset "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsmabhi/image-classification"
Extract the dataset and place it in the same directory as the code files.

Instructions
Install Python Libraries:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download and Prepare Dataset
Download the dataset from Kaggle using the link provided above.
Extract the dataset and place the extracted folder in the same directory as your code files.

Run Initial Training:
Open your Python environment or IDE.
Run the first cell of the code. This process will take some time as it involves training the model.

Save and Load Model:
Run the subsequent cells that save the trained model.
Load the saved model to ensure it is working correctly.

Run the Front-End Application:
Open app.py in any code editor.
Run app.py to start the application.
-python app.py

Add Streamlit to the project if not already included:
pip install streamlit
Run the Streamlit application:
streamlit run app.py

Test the Model:
A window will open in your browser, serving as the front-end for the project.
Select an image file from the dataset to test the accuracy of the model.
